For play-a-turn:
Run make- it will run all tests and generate a play-a-turn file, then just ./test-play-a-turn -v play-a-turn.


For tournament player:
Run ./tournament.
Then go to src/tsuro/game/RunTournament.java and run its main- I have three players now but you can change to whatever number of players you want.
You should be able to see the players in the tournament. Now I am using localhost and Port 12345.
To change Port and host information, just go to ClientPlayer.java and change.
